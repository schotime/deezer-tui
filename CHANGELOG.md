# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- `↑` / `↓` move through a narrowed list while still typing in a filter (Favorites, Explore, Downloads, playlist/offline details, playlist picker), instead of being ignored until `Enter`
- The "System (Omarchy)" theme is only listed when an Omarchy palette is detected; elsewhere new installs default to Dark Purple, and a saved Omarchy theme displays as Dark Purple until Omarchy is present

## [1.18.0] - 2026-09-14

### Added
- Like/favorite track mechanism similar to Deezer web interface:
    * Player bar heart icon (`♥` / `♡`) for currently playing track with click-to-toggle
    * `L` (Shift+L) and `Ctrl+L` global shortcuts to toggle like on focused track or currently playing track
    * `L` / `f` shortcuts in Album, Playlist, Artist Top Tracks, and Genre track detail overlays
    * Heart indicator ` ♥` next to track titles across all lists and tables for liked tracks
    * Synchronized and cached favorite track IDs between daemon and client
    * Heart indicator (`♥`) in the terminal window/tab title when the playing track is liked

### Changed
- Current playing track marker in track lists is now animated. Paused tracks marker is `⏸`.

### Fixed
- Playing a track that Deezer substitutes with a `FALLBACK` release no longer breaks UI matching: the played track keeps the requested `SNG_ID` and credits, so its row shows the playing marker, the player bar heart reflects the real favorite state and the terminal title heart appears

## [1.17.0] - 2026-08-28

### Added
- Terminal integration (PR #26):
    * Panic hook restoring raw mode / alternate screen / cursor on crash
    * Dynamic terminal window title with the playing track (rewritten only when it changes)
    * `--status` with human-readable and `--json` output for tmux, Waybar, Polybar and scripts
    * CLI playback flags: `--play`, `--pause`, `--stop`, `--volume`, `--volume-up/down`, `--seek`, `--seek-forward/backward`, `--shuffle`, `--repeat`, `--like`, `--dislike`
    * Shell completions generator (`--completions bash|zsh|fish`), installed by `install.sh`

### Fixed
- `next`, `previous` and end-of-track auto-advance now play the downloaded copy of a track while offline, instead of refusing with "No internet connection" and falling silent (#27)
- While offline, a queue holding tracks that were never downloaded is walked forward to the next available one instead of stopping on the first miss (#27)
- A track fetch that fails on a connection lost mid-session falls back to the downloaded copy when there is one, instead of skipping the track (#27)
- Typing `i` in the filter of a downloaded playlist no longer opens the info modal instead of inserting the character; `?` had the same leak (#28)

### Security
- Track and artist names from the API are stripped of control characters before being written to the terminal title (OSC escape) or printed by `--status`; a `BEL` in a track name could previously close the OSC string and let the remainder be interpreted as terminal escape sequences

## [1.16.0] - 2026-08-17

### Added
- Title search inside an open playlist by title or artist (#22)

### Fixed
- Browser login on macOS no longer attempts the Linux-only `xdg-mime`/`.desktop` URI handler setup (which always failed silently); goes straight to the manual paste fallback
- `open_browser` now uses macOS's `open` instead of hoping `firefox`/`chromium` are literal binaries on `PATH`

## [1.15.2] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed
- Opening a private playlist is not working (#17)
- Previous track under shuffle now steps back through the tracks actually
  played, instead of jumping to the queue's preceding track

### Changed
- Shuffle is now a full pass over the queue — each track plays once per cycle —
  instead of an endless random walk.
- Enabling shuffle now turns repeat off. Shuffle + repeat can still be set by enabling shuffle first
- On "Repeat one" loops on current track + next/prev will resumes the shuffle
  cycle if shuffle is on

## [1.15.1] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed
- Client/daemon IPC desync causing "Communication error" JSON parse failures (#16, #19)
- Hardcoded French "titres" in the Albums and Playlists track-count column (#18)
- `r` (repeat) and `s` (shuffle) were ignored in every overlays (album, artist, playlist, podcast, genre, offline detail, waiting list) (#15)
- Private and collaborative playlists were missing from the Playlists tab (#17)
- The cursor now moves inside the viewport, which only scrolls once the cursor reaches an edge (#20)
- Expired pipe.deezer.com JWT is now refreshed and the call retried once, instead of surfacing "JWT token has expired, please reauthenticate" (#14)

## [1.15.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added
- Mouse support: 
    * click on menus, tabs, search bar...
    * scroll lists
    * can click `Flow` and `Shuffle play my favorite`
    * escape modales clicking background
    * right click to open track context menu
    * right click on bottom bar to open playing track's context menu
- Download a whole playlist for offline mode (from context menu `x`) with % progression (#13)
- New Playlists Offline tab 
- Offline filters for tracks, albums and playlists
- Offline context menu : can now remove a track, album or playlist from offline storage

- Removed the top header line (app title + status area)
- Offline albums and playlists tracks are now displayed in modals
- Track lists mark the playing track with a `●` bullet instead of `▶`, no longer confusable with the `>` cursor

### Fixed
- Opening a modal/overlay now dims the background
- The player bar now keeps its colors when an overlay is open
- Playlist and waiting-list modals now dim the background
- On image-capable terminals, closing a modal that overlapped the cover image no longer leaves fragments
- Favorites > Following page content

## [1.14.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added
- Fuzzy search (`/`) in the "Add to playlist" picker (#10)
- Repeat mode indicator (`[r]`) in the player bar

### Fixed
- Shuffle mode could get stuck unable to disable once MPRIS was active, due to a stale state reference kept after login (#11)
- Shuffle no longer replays the same track twice in a row, including right after the queue is extended
- Playlist contents were cached forever and never picked up tracks added from another device; playlists now refresh in the background on reopen (#12)
- Track count next to a playlist (Favorites > Playlists, and the "Add to playlist" picker) didn't update after tracks were added/removed from another device, even after the playlist's own track list had refreshed
- Deezer Flow could skip ahead in the stream instead of continuing sequentially when the loaded queue ran out
- Moods played only the first batch of tracks and then stopped instead of continuing
- Favorites > Recently Played header now shows the track count
- Playlist picker: `?` and `i` shortcuts no longer interrupt typing in the filter field

## [1.13.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- Audio quality picker in settings (`Ctrl+O` > Audio quality): MP3 64 / 128 / 320 / FLAC

### Fixed
- Favorites > Recently Played failing to load when list contains user-uploaded MP3 tracks (#7)
- `quality` field in `config.json` now accepts the API names (`MP3_128`, `MP3_320`, `FLAC`, `MP3_64`), as shown in the player bar, and case-insensitive. Previously only the internal PascalCase form was accepted, causing the whole config to revert to defaults on parse failure (#8)
